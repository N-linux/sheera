            Is it normal that I wanna be around you 24/7?



        </p>
        You are forced to put up with my clingy side.
        So here is the thing, since I am too attached, we gonna be having this website so that we add
        our contracts, but they be actually added by the strongest one physically that always wins wrestling, which is
        Sheera!!!! Obviously.

        <h2>
            Sirius Contract:
        </h2>
        Always tell Sheera your problem, she loves that. If Sheera does something wrong just tell her, so she
        can fix it. Something bothering you? Communicate with Sheera. You don't need her permission to go out or for
        clubbing, just let her know. You're busy or not in a mood to talk? Let Sheera know so she doesn't feel ignored.
        Sheera trusts you with her life, but if you break it once nothing will let her trust you again. She is your
        girlfriend but also your bestfriend; so, please don't find other girls to be your friends. She won't ask about
        your privacy, Sheera will respect your privacy. Wanna spend time with your friends? Go ahaead but update her if
        you
        go anywhere. You can go out alone with your female friends, all she cares about is how you act towards them.
        Kisses before bed are a MUST, even if we are fighting. Sheera can have kisses whenever and wherever she asks!!
        Sheera has needs such as: Love, attention, hugs, reassurance and communication. Since she is an overthinker and
        she has no other than Khaled to go to. Sheera will Always has khaled's back no matter what. Khaled should help
        Sheera in finding glowy warms, catch turtles, build
        swings, climb trees, collect sea shells, going on long trips, to draw on trees/walls, and
        most importantly to eat
        with her.

        <h3>
            <i>
                I may not be your first date. Your first kiss. Or your first Love. But I just want to be your last
                everything. Sometimes it is hard to find words to say how much you mean to me. If I did anything right
                in life. It was when I gave my heart to you. You complete me and make me a better person. I love you
                forever and always Khaled. Nothing will change that.
